  ## 💭 What is LCT?
  **LunarClientTools** is a simple batch script to automate few tasks related to the client, which </br>you are already able to do manually (by going through the files). The current release of LCT provides the following: </br>
  - [x] Premade Fixes
      - [x] Launcher Startup
  - [x] Profile Management Options
      - [x] List All Present Profiles in the Directory
      - [x] Auto-Detect and Generate profile_manager.json
      - [x] Manually Generate profile_manager.json with Given Values
  - [x] Clear Cache/Logs
  - [x] Delete Offline/JRE
  - [x] Navigate to .lunarclient
  - [x] Save a Copy from your Profiles
  - [x] Switch LunarClient's GPU to Dedicated/Integrated

  ## 📚 Usage
LCT has to be ran as administrator for it to work properly. This is because the entire purpose of the script is to either copy, delete, or write files, or modify Windows registry values, which require administrative privileges. The script is open-source, which means you can check the code before using it.

**Disclaimer:** LunarClientTools is a batch script, which means it works **only on Windows**, and as of LunarClient's launcher update (which only allows Windows 10 or above), the script also follows the same path. 

**LCT is not affiliated with LunarClient.**
