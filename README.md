  ## 💭 What is LCT?
  **LunarClient Tools** is a simple batch script to automate few tasks related to the client, which </br>you are already able to do manually (by going through the files). The current release of LCT provides the following: </br>
  - [x] Premade Fixes
      - [x] Launcher Startup
  - [ ] Deep Uninstall
  - [x] Clear Cache/Logs
  - [x] Delete Offline/JRE
  - [x] Navigate to .lunarclient
  - [x] Backup and Save your Profiles
  - [x] Switch to Dedicated GPU on LunarClient

  ## 📚 Usage
LCT has to be ran as administrator for it to work properly. This is because the entire purpose of the script</br>is to either copy, delete, or write files, or modify Winodws registry values, which require administrative privileges.

  ## 👨‍💻 Contributing
I made LunarClientTools without *any* coding knowledge, based on my finding on how batch works, on Google or with the help of AI. </br> You're allowed to contribute to this project as long as you provide a valid description </br> while submitting your pull request, and make sure you are requesting to pull a feature/bugfix branch.
